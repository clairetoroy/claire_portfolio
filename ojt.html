                    <p>I learned various skills such as proper document formatting for the letters my supervisor needed. I also picked up new formulas that made it easier for me to encode data. I gained proper knowledge on using the company's internal system called SAP. My job was to get familiar with and use the system. I learned how to input, create, extract, and delete information using different features. These skills helped me adjust quickly to new technologies and use them effectively for my work.</p>

                <div class="ojt-content-card">
                    <p>During my OJT experience, I had regular interactions with my colleagues, importantly my supervisor, which significantly contributed to my everyday growth. I worked closely with my supervisor who guided me through daily tasks, provided clear instructions, and offered feedback to help me improve. Through other colleagues also, I learned how to communicate effectively in a professional setting, ask appropriate questions if they gave me tasks, and meet deadlines. I also observed how my colleagues handle different responsibilities given, and maintain professionalism in the workplace. From these interactions, I learned the importance of respect, and adaptability. Overall, collaboration helped me develop a proper work ethic and confidence in a real-work environment.</p>

                <div class="ojt-content-card">
                    <p>One of the main obstacles I encountered was effective communication in a workplace setting. I found it challenging to ask questions confidently, because I was shy and introverted. To overcome this challenge, I made a conscious effort to improve my communication skills by actively listening and taking notes on how the other employees actually talk professionally to each other. Over time, my efforts improved my confidence to talk to my colleagues, and perform my responsibilities more efficiently.</p>

                    <p>One of the most notable experiences I had during my OJT was the 15 minute break. It taught me as a person that it is okay to rest. It is okay to pause things out. That 15 minute break feels like a breath of fresh air, that even in a professional setting, people have to rest their mind at some point to avoid exhausting themselves.</p>

                    <p>It aligned with my academic goals and program objectives by allowing me to apply concepts I learned in school to real workplace situations. The tasks assigned to me helped in improving my technical skills, and problem-solving. This alignment helped in narrowing the gap between classroom learning and actual industry practices, making the lessons I learned academically more relevant and meaningful. The OJT experience encouraged me to become more responsible, disciplined, and adaptable, which supported my academic goal of becoming a competent and job-ready professional.</p>
